## Calamity interpreter
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/VitahaKryvenko/calamity_interpreter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/VitahaKryvenko/calamity_interpreter)

Calamity is a general purpose dynamically typed
programming language with JavaScript-like
syntax. Documentation and specification are not ready yet.

Once it was my pure C (with GNU extensions) university project, now
I am intended to rewrite it using latest C++ version.
